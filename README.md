# Personal Portfolio

> This page is based on a Free Code Camp project about responsive web design, specifically the ‚ÄòPersonal Portfolio‚Äô project. There were changes with respect to the original page to imitate, as I changed the colors, personal data, and projects for my own. In addition, since it is a Free Code Camp project, I used the methods, tags, properties, and other necessary elements to complete the page, and even incorporated a media query.
